# Fantasy NBA Rankings Calculator in Node

## Getting Started

To use this, you'd need to have a Google Sheet set up with statistical NBA data, a registered application in the Google developers console from which you'd need to download an OAuth 2.0 Client ID as `sheets/credentials.json`, and to copy `config.example.js` to `config.js` and adjust any settings as needed.

## Running

```
yarn fetch-and-calculate
```

## Testing

```
yarn test
```
